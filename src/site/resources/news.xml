            <title>MapDB 0.9 format support</title>
            <link>http://kotek.net/blog/MapDB_09_format_support</link>

            <description>
                MapDB has currently semi-stable branch 0.9.x. My plan was to keep stable API and storage format. However
                to support some new features (store size limit, async API) I have to make changes in storage format,
                which are not backward compatible. Also now I work full-time and project is evolving much faster than I
                expected.

            <title>MapDB Reloaded</title>
            <link>http://kotek.net/blog/MapDB_Reloaded</link>
            <date>June 19 2013</date>
            <description>
                Last month I wrote about<a href="http://kotek.net/blog/MapDB_Future">the future of MapDB</a>. It was not
                very optimistic. MapDB is my hobby project and the time I could give it is severely limited. This led to
                some absurd situations: despite having a very fast db-engine I would not publish any performance
                benchmarks. I also discouraged possible users so I would not have to deal with support emails.

                MapDB 0.9.x was released a few weeks ago. Now that the project enters<i>usable alpha phase</i>, is time
                to talk about the future.

            <title>3 billion items in Java Map with 16 GB RAM</title>

                One rainy evening I meditated about memory management in Java and
                how effectively Java collections utilise memory.
                I made simple experiment, how much entries can I insert into
                Java Map with 16 GB of RAM?
