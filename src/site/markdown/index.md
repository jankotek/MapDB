Features
--------
* **Concurrent** - MapDB has record level locking and state-of-art concurrent engine. Its performance scales nearly linearly with number of cores. Data can be written by multiple parallel threads.

* **Fast** - MapDB has outstanding performance rivaled only by native DBs. It is result of more than a decade of optimizations and rewrites.

* **ACID** - MapDB optionally supports ACID transactions with full MVCC isolation. MapDB uses write-ahead-log or append-only store for great write durability.

* **Flexible** - MapDB can be used everywhere from in-memory cache to multi-terabyte database. It also has number of options to trade durability for write performance. This makes it very easy to configure MapDB to exactly fit your needs.

* **Hackable** - MapDB is component based, most features (instance cache, async writes, compression) are just class wrappers. It is very easy to introduce new functionality or component into MapDB.

* **SQL Like** - MapDB was developed as faster alternative to SQL engine. It has number of features which makes transition from relational database easier: secondary indexes/collections, autoincremental sequential ID, joints, triggers, composite keys...

* **Low disk-space usage** - MapDB has number of features (serialization, delta key packing...) to minimize disk used by its store. It also has very fast compression and custom serializers. We take disk-usage seriously and do not waste single byte.
